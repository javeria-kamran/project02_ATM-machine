'''A brief description of what this project does and who it's for:

First create a folder of any unique name you want and open it in Visual studio code.
Then open the terminal and make a tsconfig file by writting the foloowing command:

tsc --init

after this, write:

npm init 

command to initialize package.json file it will ask you some questions like package name , version description and you have to do nothing with that just press enter to proceed further.

For taking users input on CLI we have to install inquirer.For this write this command in your terminal:

npm install inquirer

it will install inquirer in your computer and it will also generate a folder of node modules in your main folder as well as pacakgelock.json file.

Now,
In your main.ts file , start coding as given above in main.ts file .you have to import inquirer from node module's inquirer.

NECESSARY CHANGES:
-In your tsconfig file,
 (in line 14 you have to chnage the target to "es2020".)
(in line 28 chnage the module to "nodeNext".)
(in line 30, uncomment it and then also change the moduleresolution to "nodeNext")

-In your package.json file after the fifth line just after it you will add("type": "module").

NOTE:
While compiling your typescript file to JavaScript file , make sure you just write (tsc) in your terminal.if you write your file name along with tsc it will not take the change we made in previous files it doesn't update your code .'''
